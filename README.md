## Download

The MoPub SDK is available via:

1. **jCenter AAR**
    
    [ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/mopub/mopub-android-sdk/mopub-android-sdk/images/download.svg)](https://bintray.com/mopub/mopub-android-sdk/mopub-android-sdk/_latestVersion)  
    The MoPub SDK is available as an AAR via jCenter; to use it, add the following to your `build.gradle`.
    
    ```
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }

    dependencies {
        compile('com.mopub:mopub-sdk:3.11.0@aar') {
            transitive = true
        }
    }
    ```

    **To continue integration using the mopub-sdk AAR, please see the [Getting Started guide](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-android-sdk/wiki/Getting-Started#updating-your-android-manifest).**

2. **Zipped Source**

    The MoPub SDK is also distributed as zipped source code that you can include in your application.  MoPub provides two prepackaged archives of source code:

    **[MoPub Android Full SDK.zip](http://bit.ly/YUdU9v)**  
    _Includes everything you need to serve MoPub ads *and* built-in support for Millennial Media third party ad network - [Millennial Media](http://www.millennialmedia.com/) - including the required third party binaries._
    
    _**Note:** Millennial Media has updated their minimum supported version of Android to 4.1 (API level 16+). The MoPub Android Full SDK manifest and build.gradle files have been updated accordingly._
    
    _**Note:** Millennial Media has deprecated support for Ant/Eclipse; migrating users should use the MoPub Android base SDK and follow [Millennial's Ant/Eclipse Integration Guide](http://docs.millennialmedia.com/android-ad-sdk/ant-eclipse-integration-guide.html)._
    
    **[MoPub Android Base SDK.zip](http://bit.ly/YUdWhH)**  
    _Includes everything you need to serve MoPub ads.  No third party ad networks are included._
    
    **For additional integration instructions, please see the [Getting Started guide](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-android-sdk/wiki/Getting-Started#requirements-and-dependencies).**

3. **Cloned GitHub repository**
    
    Alternatively, you can obtain the MoPub SDK source by cloning the git repository:
    
    `git clone git://github.com/mopub/mopub-android-sdk.git`
    
    **For additional integration instructions, please see the [Getting Started guide](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-android-sdk/wiki/Getting-Started#requirements-and-dependencies).**
